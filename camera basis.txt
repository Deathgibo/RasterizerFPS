calculus 3

to create a basis you need a vector equation of the line and the derivative gives you the first basis which points in the parralel direction of the tangent to that point

now normalize it and take the derivate that derivative is orthogonal because if the points of a function all have same length its proven that the derivative * original = 0

so now just cross product those to get the binormal

you have the unit tangent vector, the unit normal vector, and the binormal vector
